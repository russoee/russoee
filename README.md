# Security in Practice, Not Just in Theory  
**Remediation Automation | IOC Investigations | Hardened Configurations**

Welcome — I’m [Eric Russo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/russo-eric/), a cybersecurity practitioner focused on reducing risk through hands-on security engineering, vulnerability remediation, and threat detection. My portfolio showcases real-world, lab-tested solutions built using tools like PowerShell, Tenable Nessus, Microsoft Defender, and KQL — all centered around proactive security.

##  Active Projects

###  **Vulnerability Management with Tenable**
- Designed and deployed a full vulnerability management program using Tenable.
- Includes policy creation, scan scheduling, report analysis, and risk-based prioritization.
- Simulates stakeholder communication and remediation workflows to reflect enterprise operations.

###  **Threat Hunting & IOC Investigations**
- Threat scenarios built in a live cyber range environment using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and KQL.
- Investigations include file tracking, steganography detection, data exfiltration, and remote access misuse.
- Projects structured to reflect incident response, detection engineering, and post-incident reporting.

###  **Security Hardening with PowerShell & Bash**
- Remediation scripts aligned with DISA STIG and CIS benchmarks.
- Includes idempotent PowerShell and Bash automation for enforcing secure configurations on Windows and Linux.
- Scripts follow standardized templates with metadata, testing notes, and verification instructions.
